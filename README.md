## 🚀 About The Project

**ADHARA** is a cutting-edge early detection system designed to identify hidden "learning friction" in children—subtle signs of potential learning difficulties like Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, or ADHD—before they become roadblocks.

Unlike traditional testing, ADHARA uses a **gamified, stress-free environment** where children play simple activities while our multimodal AI analyzes behavioral signals in real-time.

### ✨ The "Secret Sauce" (Multimodal Analysis)
We don't just look at answers. We analyze **HOW** a child answers:

*   👀 **Gaze Tracking:** Are they distracted? Focusing on the wrong elements?
*   🙂 **Micro-Expression Analysis:** Frustration, confusion, or joy? (via `face-api.js`)
*   🖱️ **Mouse Dynamics:** Hesitation loops, jitter, and confidence velocity.
*   🎤 **Voice Patterning:** Stammer detection, filler words, and reading fluency.

## 🎮 Key Features

### 🧩 Adaptive AI Questioning
The system evolves with the child. Based on real-time performance, it dynamically adjusts the complexity and type of questions during the session to probe specific areas of concern without overwhelming the learner.

### 📊 Clinical-Grade Reporting
Generates professional, competition-ready reports for educators:
*   **Plain Text PDFs:** Clean, academic formatting without "weird text".
*   **Friction Badges:** Instant visual indicators of learning ease.
*   **Domain Analysis:** Deep dives into Phonological Processing, Numerical Cognition, and Executive Function.

### 🎨 Beautiful, Child-Friendly UI
*   **Animated Mascots:** Encouraging guides that react to the child.
*   **Dynamic Animations:** Smooth transitions and rewarding visuals.
*   **Glassmorphism & Gradients:** A premium, modern aesthetic that feels like a high-end app.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** React + Vite (Fast, Modern)
*   **AI/ML:**
    *   `face-api.js` (Browser-based Computer Vision)
    *   `Web Speech API` (Native Voice Recognition)
    *   `Ollama` (Local Large Language Model for Privacy 🔒)
*   **Styling:** Vanilla CSS3 with modern Variables & Animations
