# ADHARA 🪔  
### Early Detection of Learning Friction using AI

ADHARA is an AI-assisted early warning system designed to identify **learning friction**
during normal learning activities.  
It supports educators by flagging **early indicators of learning difficulty** before
academic failure occurs.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Learning difficulties are often identified **too late**, after repeated academic failure.
Teachers and parents lack tools to notice **early behavioral signals** during learning itself.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview
ADHARA passively observes learning interactions such as:
- hesitation
- repeated retries
- response inconsistency
- disengagement

Using these signals, the system highlights **learning friction levels**
and provides explainable insights for **human review**.

> ⚠️ ADHARA is **not a diagnostic or medical tool**.
> It supports early educational screening only.
