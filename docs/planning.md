🔒 ADHARA — FINAL CONTEXT & JUDGE SCRIPT

(Safe, Ethical, Implementable, Phase-2 Ready)

1️⃣ WHAT ADHARA IS (LOCK THIS)

ADHARA is an AI-assisted early warning system that observes learning interaction patterns during everyday learning tasks to identify early learning friction.

It does not diagnose

It does not label students

It supports educators, not replaces them

Students only see “Task completed”

2️⃣ CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Tasks are not tests.
Tasks are lenses to observe learning behavior.

We do not evaluate correctness alone.
We observe how the learner interacts while attempting the task.

3️⃣ TASK FRAMEWORK (REVISED & SAFE)

We use three simple, age-appropriate learning activities that students already encounter in daily learning.

These tasks are:

short

familiar

low-stress

non-evaluative

Each task exists only to trigger interaction patterns.

4️⃣ TASK 1 — Reading & Symbol Recognition Task

(Reframed safely)

What the learner sees

A short, playful sentence:

“big bad dog bit the bed”

And a simple choice activity:

Is this letter b or d?

Is this letter p or q?

What we observe (NOT what we test)

reading hesitation

cursor backtracking

correction attempts

time spent per symbol

interaction consistency

What this task helps indicate

Possible reading-related learning friction

⚠️ We do not say reading disorder.
We say reading interaction friction.

5️⃣ TASK 2 — Writing / Motor Interaction Task

(Reframed safely)

What the learner does

Copy a simple word like “hello”

Draw a smooth circle on screen (or input pad)

What we observe

mouse or pointer smoothness

hesitation before strokes

over-correction

repeated redraw attempts

interaction fatigue patterns

What this task helps indicate

Possible writing or motor-coordination learning friction

⚠️ We do not evaluate handwriting quality.
We observe interaction effort.

6️⃣ TASK 3 — Number Interaction Task

(Reframed safely)

What the learner sees

Count visible dots (8–10)

Answer one very simple arithmetic question

What we observe

response latency

indecision before answering

multiple changes

abandonment or restart

What this task helps indicate

Possible numerical reasoning or processing friction

⚠️ We do not judge intelligence or math ability.

7️⃣ SIGNALS COLLECTED (SAFE NAMING)
A) Interaction Dynamics Monitor (IDM)

mouse hesitation

correction loops

jitter / path inefficiency

idle-with-movement

task abandonment

B) On-Device Session Presence Signals (Optional)

non-identifying visual engagement consistency

session continuity cues

⚠️ These are optional, on-device, and not core to decisions.

8️⃣ HOW AI IS USED (VERY IMPORTANT)

AI does NOT:

name conditions

assign diagnoses

compute probabilities

declare accuracy

AI DOES:

align signals by timestamp

summarize cross-task patterns

explain observations in plain language

suggest next learning steps

9️⃣ AI OUTPUT (STRICT FORMAT)
Teacher-only view shows:

Learning Friction Level

Expected

Elevated

High

Explanation (1–2 lines)
Example:

“Repeated hesitation and correction during reading tasks exceeded expected patterns for this age group.”

Recommendation

“Consider a shorter guided reading activity or alternate content format.”

Student view shows:

“Task completed. Thank you!”

🔟 WHAT “NEXT TASK” MEANS (IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION)

When AI suggests a next task, it means:

simpler version

shorter session

different content format

guided support

It does NOT mean:

medical referral

diagnosis

classification

This keeps ADHARA educational.

1️⃣1️⃣ HOW TO ANSWER JUDGE QUESTIONS (SCRIPTED)
❓ “How do these tasks identify disorders?”

“They don’t.
They help us observe learning interaction patterns during normal activities.”

❓ “Each student is different. How do you handle that?”

“We normalize behavior against age-appropriate baseline expectations.
We never compare students to each other.”

❓ “Who designs the questions?”

“Educators design them as interaction triggers, not assessments.”

❓ “Why so few questions?”

“Because more questions distort natural behavior and introduce fatigue.”

❓ “What is the innovation?”

“We detect struggle while learning is happening, not after failure.”

1️⃣2️⃣ CRITICAL LANGUAGE RULES (DO NOT BREAK)

❌ NEVER SAY:

disease names

diagnosis

abnormal child

probability

accurate result

early stage of condition

✅ ALWAYS SAY:

learning friction

interaction patterns

early warning

heuristic indication

educator review

1️⃣3️⃣ FINAL ONE-LINE SUMMARY (MEMORIZE THIS)

“ADHARA observes how students interact during everyday learning tasks and helps educators notice learning friction early — without labeling or diagnosing.”

1️⃣4️⃣ FINAL STATUS CHECK

✔ Tasks defined
✔ Signals aligned
✔ AI role bounded
✔ Ethics protected
✔ Judge concerns answered

You are safe, credible, and competitive.
